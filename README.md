# Trend Advertising ðŸš€

**Trend Advertising** is an AI-powered trend forecasting platform that clusters emerging social media trends, viral advertisements, and creator content to help marketers and influencers stay ahead of what's next.

We use web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning models to extract signals from platforms like Instagram and Twitter, then apply deep learning models to identify, classify, and predict trends in real-time.
